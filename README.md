# SQL Employee Database Analysis

# Project Overview
This project showcases my SQL skills in database design, data import, and query optimization. I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to structure tables, imported CSV files into a relational database, and performed complex queries to extract meaningful insights about the data.

* I received help from Brian Perry with my Entity Relationship Diagram during office hours.
